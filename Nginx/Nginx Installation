Step 1 – Installing Nginx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
--------
Step 2 – Adjusting the Firewall
sudo ufw app list

#[ Nginx Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) 
  and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
  Nginx HTTP: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
  Nginx HTTPS: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic) ]

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'         #Right now, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80. You can enable this by using command
sudo ufw status                     #You can verify the change
----------
Step 3 – Checking your Web Server
systemctl status nginx

http://your_server_ip

Step 4 – Managing the Nginx Process
sudo systemctl stop nginx     #To stop your web server
sudo systemctl start nginx    #To start the web server when it is stopped
sudo systemctl restart nginx  #To stop and then start the service again
sudo systemctl reload nginx   #If you are only making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections.
sudo systemctl disable nginx  #By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior 
sudo systemctl enable nginx   #To re-enable the service to start up at boot
