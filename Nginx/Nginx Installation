Step 1 – Installing Nginx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

Step 2 – Adjusting the Firewall
sudo ufw app list

#[ Nginx Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) 
  and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
  Nginx HTTP: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
  Nginx HTTPS: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic) ]

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'         #Right now, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80. You can enable this by using command
sudo ufw status                     #You can verify the change

Step 3 – Checking your Web Server
systemctl status nginx

http://your_server_ip
