Step 1: Update system repositories
sudo apt update 

Step 2: Installation of Java
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
java -version

sudo apt-cache search tomcat

Step 4: Install Apache Tomcat Server on Ubuntu 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tomcat9 tomcat9-admin tomcat9-common tomcat9-user
sudo systemctl status tomcat9


Step 5: Check ports for Apache Tomcat Server
ss -ltn

Step 6: Open ports for Apache Tomcat Server
[In case if the UFW firewall is activated on your system, then it may cause trouble while connecting external devices. So, 
to permit the incoming from any type of source to port “8080”, write out the following “ufw” command]
sudo ufw allow from any to any port 8080 proto tcp

Step 7: Test working of Apache Tomcat Server
publicip:8080


**********How to use Apache Tomcat Web Application Manager on Ubuntu **********

**********deploy a web application to Tomcat***********
1. Prepare Your Application
mvn clean package

2. Deploy the Application
#Copy the WAR File to Tomcat's Webapps Directory:
sudo cp /path/to/your-application.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/

#Verify the Deployment:
ls /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/

#Check Tomcat Logs:If the application doesn't appear to be deploying correctly, check the Tomcat logs for errors
sudo tail -f /var/log/tomcat9/catalina.out

3. Access the Deployed Application
#Navigate to the Application URL:If your WAR file was named myapp.war, you can access the application at
http://publicip:8080/myapp

4. Manage the Deployment
#Using Tomcat Manager:If you want to manage your deployments through the Tomcat Manager application,
you need to upload the WAR file using the Manager's deployment form. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and access:

Go to the Tomcat Manager at http://13.233.230.87:8080/manager/html
Log in with the credentials you configured.
Use the "Deploy" section to upload your WAR file or deploy it from the file system.

#Manual Removal:To remove an application, delete the corresponding WAR file and the directory it created:
sudo rm /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/myapp.war
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/myapp
